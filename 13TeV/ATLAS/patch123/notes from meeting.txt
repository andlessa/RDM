.)	add functionality to expres eg	expres.getModel(tx)
									  .getModelAccuracy(tx) (..)

.)	models can be combined, but losing option to upgrade / retrain individual performance (eg classification)
	

.)	denormalize?
	maybe instead rescale by constant value to get close to ~1 range
	( currently normalized by: v = v / |v|_p )


.)	classification range? currently 0-2500GeV

.)	delimiter for classification dynamic and saved per model?

.) make testmodel more sensitive to mass poles, check whether to use intermediate or final mass for 3dim txs.

ATLAS-SUSY-2016-15:

	d) needs new topo? 
		you said to use T2tt but then UL masses would be very wrong + tops are created by gluino decay, not stop?

		constraint -> mass difference between ~t and N1 is small i.e.: delta_m(~t,N1) = 5GeV





=== NOTES ===

smodels v.1.2.3


2016-24:
	write comments:	e.g.: validation/T2.comment

	.) TChiWZ		comment: ATLAS gives data point here and here (0,100), no points in regional space, 
					still interpolating over data points because blabla (left bottom corner) ... interpolate over data points

	.) TSlepSlep	comment: "we see there are wild fluctuations in the original data that ATLAS smoothed out, we understand dip in 100/200 in mass plane, 						discrepancy stems from ATLAS smoothing their lines(data?)"

					runFilecreater or slha creater to create more datapoints for tarball for x range > 450 for TSlepSlep (to 600-700GeV) pythia 8

	.) TChiChipmSlepSlep 	(the most wrong one) run xsec for 1 file in pythia8 with 50k events (<-obsolete?)
							might be TChiChipmSlepL <- yes it is, replace it!
		
							check ATLAS-SUSY-2013-12 8TeV  factor of 2. in constraint because analysis not sensitive to neutrinos (half of the time there are nus)

							squark masses set to way too low masses! at least 1e5TeV!!

	effmap: disregard neutrinos in tx constraint, *2 multiply necessary somewhere (not sure where)


2016-27:

	FOR ALL TXNAMES WITH NEAR MASSLESS FINAL STATES: copy mass plane with 0GeV and 1GeV so software can interpolate between them!!
	-> do it eg for T5Gamma

	update all validation plots with new gravitino tarballs

	.) T5Gamma 			is fine

	.) T5ZGamma			constraint as sum of 3 possibilities:   Z y, y y and Z Z
						also add condition: Csim( constraint[Z,y], 2*constraint[y,y], 2*constraint[Z,Z] )

	.) T6Gamma 			topology wrong: actual squarks produced: L: u,d,c,s,b,t	R: d,s,b
						constraint: [jet,y][jet,y] (as i had) + [b,y][b,y]
		
	.) TChipChimGamma: 	rerun validation without k-factor and updated gravitino templates
						run xsec computer on each individual tarball file with small script on pythia 8


2016-27-eff:
	
	.) T5Gamma 			remove eff map
						write into global.info comment line through the convert.py file something like: 
						"eff map for T5Gamma were not implemented because it assumes specific branching ratios"


2017-02:

	.) TChiZ: 			try again



if done set validation flag in info file to True

			T2tt: 	compared off region with 2016-17: for dm < 80 : T2bbWWoff, but tar file got removed? (remnants still in juhi branch)
					also bug: source: 'CMS' instead of 'ATLAS' in T2bbWWoff.txt file ?

			T2ttg: 	template done with stop_1 // stop_1 & stop_2 still no good points for validation plot?
					approximate runtime fÃ¼r pythia8 50k events: ~2460min

					pretty desc need to be added

		eff

			T2tt:	not very pretty

			T2bb:	not very pretty

			write comment that info for last eff-map could not be found



2017-01	ul

			TChiWH: pretty name not sure
					chose most excluding UL map
					validation UL map: weird area around [600/0] to [700/0]


		eff

			TChiWH: validation EM produced not pretty at all

2016-15:

	.) T2tt: offshell region -> copy entry in convert.py for off shell txname T2ttoff
		follow curve of fig_08.png to gain mass constraint like [massMin < dm < massMax] for W to be on shell (i think?)
		^- just see how they did it on different result

	.) T2ttg (name pending) copy T2tt but exchange ~t to ~g and have ~t as lsp

2016-15-eff:
	
	.) SRDlow & SRDhigh = T2bb, the others should be T2tt & T2ttoff combined (same trick as on UL)

	write comment for global.info file that information for last SR could not be found

2017-01:

	.)  TChipChipmWH: should be TChiWH
		wrong topology! TChiWH already exists
