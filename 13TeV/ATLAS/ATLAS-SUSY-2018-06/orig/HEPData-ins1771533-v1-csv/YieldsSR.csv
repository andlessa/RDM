#: name: Yields SR
#: description: The observed and expected yields after the background-only fit in the SRs. The normalization factors of the $WZ$ sample for the low-mass and ISR regions are different and are treated separately in the combined fit. \The "Top-quark like" category contains the tt&#772;, Wt, and WW processes while the "Others" category contains backgrounds from triboson production and processes that include a Higgs boson, 3 or more tops, and tops produced in association with W or Z bosons. Combined statistical and systematic uncertainties are presented. The individual uncertainties can be correlated and do not necessarily add in quadrature to equal the total background uncertainty.
