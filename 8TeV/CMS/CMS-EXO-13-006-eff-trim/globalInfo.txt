comment: Search for long-lived charged particles implemented in arXiv:1509.00473. For the topologies with mixed MET-HSCP branches, the MET branch is irrelevant and wildcards are used. The topologies THSCPM1b and THSCPM2b refer to staus, while in 1509.00473 charginos were used. All topologies do not include intermediate BSM states in the production process. The THSCPM5, THSCPM6 and THSCPM7 topologies do not include width information
