comment: "The validation curve is a single point, since the UL is a 1D map. The value quoted by CMS is m_stau < 340 GeV is excluded, which agrees with the plot (m_stau < 350 GeV). Note that the efficiencies are for chargino pair production (THSCPM1), but for comparing to CMS exclusion curve we should use the THSCPM1b topogoly (stau pair production)."
