Used the cutbased implementation for T2tt since efficiencies are available, so for this topology we are comparing the same kind of results
UL cutbased, EM cut based.
Used the BDT analysis for the the T6bbWW (only one mass plane is available for efficiency maps,
so we cannot produce the maps for the other mass planes) -> the BDT gives better limits.

Lines digitized by hand (FA) for T2tt or saved inside a .C macro for the T6bbWW,
since they cannot be retrive directly from data files provided i.e. not a suitable format for convert.py.
