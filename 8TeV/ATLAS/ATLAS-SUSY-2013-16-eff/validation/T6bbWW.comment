comment: "Following comment by Ursula Laa
1) cross section, efficiency matching official ones 
(checked for T6bbWW_448_194_97_448_194_97), no UL map given, cannot compare further...
2) ATLAS is combining orthogonal SRs for the limit, resulting exclusion limit 
from SRA+SRB type signal regions, see 
http://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/SUSY-2013-16/figaux_08d.png 
but this makes the results even more ambigous
3) e.g. point 450, 100 which is not excluded by ATLAS, limit obtained from A1+C2, 
smodels finds C2 most sensitvie, adding A1 should lead to stronger constraints in 
my opinion, see http://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/SUSY-2013-16/tab_11.png
but cannot do full comparison, we dont have T6bbWW efficiencies for SRA type signal regions, 
for some reason they are not on hepdata
4) I would remove this from the database! Cannot think of anything more to check, 
necessary material maybe not available
