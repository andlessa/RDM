comment: "The data grid has a very large value at (500,100),\
which results in large UL around mgluino ~500 GeV. Consequently,\
there is a region of allowed points due to the interpolation for\
low values of the LSP mass and mgluino ~500 GeV.\
A similar thing happens on the upper left corner of the exclusion curve.\
Except for that the results seem consistent."
