Originally, for fixed mass LSP limits, the exclusion plots have the value x = M_Chargino-M_LSP)/ (M_Mother-M_LSP) , 0<=x <= 1 . These values have been converted to the chargino mass, and the exclusion line points re-valuated.
This explains why the esclusion curves in the validation plots look weird.
