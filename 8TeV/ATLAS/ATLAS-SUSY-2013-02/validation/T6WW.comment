comment: "in their slha files, they only had the left handed squarks non-decoupled, so one has to compare with half the signal cross section. Also, in the official exclusion plot for LSP=60 GeV, there is a non-excluded island at around msquark=420 x=.16, which hasnt been digitised and thus doesnt appear in our plots, see https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/SUSY-2013-02/figaux_11c.png"
