comment: "The data grid has a gap on the upper left\
side of the exclusion curve. As a result, the interpolation\
in this region may give UL values higher than the ones used by ATLAS.\
Consequently there is a small band of allowed points in this region.
Otherwise, the results seem consistent.\
Also, the ATLAS data file contained entries with UL = 0. As a result,\
any point close to this data entry would be excluded, independent of how\
small its cross-section. I have removed such entries from the orig file."
