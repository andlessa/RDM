comment: "as can be seen in upperLimit_T6bbWWoff_2Eqmother300.0_Eqinter0x_Eqlspy.pdf, the upper limit value at mchi+=100 gev, mchi0=90 gev of 384 pb strongly influences the interpolated upper limits all the way down to mlsp=50 gev. that explain the difference of our exclusion to the official exclusion line"
