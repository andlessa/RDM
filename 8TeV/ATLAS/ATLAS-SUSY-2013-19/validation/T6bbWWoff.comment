comment: "There are a number of things wrong with these\
ATLAS results for T6bbWWoff. First, the entries in HEPDATA\
corresponding to T6bbWWC106.txt have two points (x,75.),\
when one of them should read (x,95.). Second, the grid is\
very sparse and the UL jump orders of magnitude. Third,\
the values in HEPDATA do not match the values in the plot.\
For instance, in Fig.3D (mC1 = 2 mLSP), the point (275.,50.)\
has an UL of 1.57 in the plot, while the data file has 27.67.\
As a result, the interpolation produces a gap inside the exclusion\
curve. Due to such a large number of inconsistencies, it is not\
advisable to use these results."
