comment: "The ATLAS grid is sparse, so interpolation happens over\
almost an order of magnitude. Also, the NLLfast cross-sections for \
stop pair production are somewhat smaller (by 10-20%) than the CMS reference\
cross-sections. Using Prospino to compute the cross-sections, one can see\
that there is still a large uncertainty in the NLO cross-section (~20%),\
so even though the excluded region seems slightly smaller, the results\
are consistent with the uncertainties."
