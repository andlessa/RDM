comment: "The Fastlim grid assumes msquark = mgluino. Hence, for msq=0.96*mg, all points extrapolate
the grid. If we require the default 5% agreement in the extrapolation, all points above mLSP = 400 GeV
get None efficiencies. Relaxing this agreement requirement to 25%, the official exclusion curve can be
well reproduced."
