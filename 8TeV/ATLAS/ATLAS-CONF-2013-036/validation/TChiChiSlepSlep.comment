comment: The plane in Fig.1b has one line with UL values one or two orders 
of magnitude above the other points. As a result, whenever the interpolation 
uses one of these points, the interpolated UL value becomes much higher, 
resulting in regions of allowed points inside the curves. Furthermore, 
the original data has a big gap around the legend box in the original plot. 
As a result, several regions of the parameter space can not be interpolated. 
Due to these issues we do not use this result."
