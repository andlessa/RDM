comment: "The plane in Fig.1b has one line with UL\
values one or two orders of magnitude above\
the other points. As a result, whenever the interpolation\
uses one of these points, the interpolated UL value becomes\
much higher, resulting in regions of allowed points inside\
the curves. Furthermore, the original data has a big gap\
around the legend box in the original plot. As a result,
several regions of the parameter space can not be interpolated.\
Due to these issues we do not use this result."
